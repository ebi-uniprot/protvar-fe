###### <a name="protvar-api"></a>ProtVar API

![ProtVar API](images/protvar_api.png)

#### Website Help Further Information

<a name="3d-structure-viewer"></a>**3D Structure Viewer:** 3D structures are visualised using the Mol* viewer which “is a modern web-based open-source toolkit for visualisation and analysis of large-scale molecular data”. Further information can be found at their website: https://molstar.org/
ProtVar uses a limited version of Mol* with less functionality than the full version to allow proteins to be displayed quickly and smoothly.  

<a name="annotations"></a>**Annotations:** Annotations are subdivided into function annotations, population observations and structure annotations. Annotations either help the user to understand the function of the reference amino acid at the variant position, evaluate the likelihood that the variant amino acid will alter the functional and contextualise the variant position and protein role to suggest what effect the variant may have on the organism.

<a name="cadd"></a>**CADD:** CADD scores “the deleteriousness of single nucleotide variants as well as insertion/deletions variants in the human genome” - from https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/ CADD scores are freely available for all non-commercial applications however a licence is required for commercial applications, details of which can be found on their website. CADD citation: ref doi: 10.1038/ng.2892

<a name="co-located-variants"></a>**Co-located Variants:** ProtVar retrieves variants which have been reported at the same amino acid position as the variant. This mean that the point mutation itself may be any of the three nucleotide position of the codon, not necessarily the same genomic position as the user entered variant.

<a name="contact"></a>**Contact:** If you have any problems using ProtVar or cannot retrieve the data you want then please use the contact form to get in touch with the ProtVar team who will do their best to assist you. Additionally if you have any suggestions to improve ProtVar or requests to add something new to help your work then please let us know.

<a name="data-types"></a>**Data Types:** The following variant input data types are currently supported by ProtVar: [VCF](#vcf), [gnomAD](#gnomad), [HGVS](#HGVS), [Protein position](#protein-position), [dbSNP ID](#dbsnp-id).  

Examples of each of the formats can be found to the right of the paste input box.
A mixture of formats can be submitted. For example:    
>rs864622779  
P22304 A205P  
X 149498202 . C G  

ProtVar will evaluate each one and map them to the protein position in a unified format.

<a name="dbsnp-id"></a>**dbSNP ID:** dbSNP is a resource which “contains human single nucleotide variations, microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions." The resource can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/. Variants in ProtVar can be searched in the paste box or uploaded using the dbSNP RefSNP ID for example: rs4148323. 
Because dbSNP IDs may represent more than one variant allele, ProtVar will separate the different variant alleles onto different lines on the mapping page. This is because the different variant alleles may have different consequences to the protein

<a name="download"></a>**Download:** Downloads can be tailored according to the users’ needs. If only mappings from genomic coordinates to protein positions are required then “mappings only” can be used. If specific annotations are required then these can be selected individually. Each annotation category selected adds extra time to produce the downloadable file. Files ready for download are displayed in the ~My Downloads” section. Optionally users can add a job name to keep track of multiple jobs and an email address so that they can be informed when the file is ready to be downloaded. All of the annotations in the download file can also be accessed programmatically via the ProtVar REST API.

<a name="ensembl-identifiers"></a>**Ensembl identifiers:**

<a name="eve"></a>**EVE:** EVE is “a model for the prediction of clinical significance of human variants based on sequences of diverse organisms across evolution”. To cite the use of EVE scores: (ref doi: 10.1038/s41586-021-04207-6)
To explore EVE scores further visit the website: https://evemodel.org/

<a name="function-annotationse"></a>**Function Annotations:** Function annotations are principally sourced from UniProt. There are three sections. The first section contains annotations describing the variant position only. The second section describes the region surrounding the variant as the variant may play a role in a function reliant on the region. The third section describes the role of the protein more generally in order for the user to predict the effect on the organism if the variant affects protein function.

<a name="file-upload"></a>**File Upload:**

<a name="general-protein-information"></a>**General protein information:**

<a name="genomic-position"></a>**Genomic position:**

<a name="genome-assembly"></a>**Genome Assembly:** All of the annotations in ProtVar are based upon the mappings between GRCh38 assembly and the UniProt canonical isoform sequence. However, ProtVar does support coordinates in GRCh37 which can be uploaded or pasted to search. ProtVar will map the positions from the GRCh37 to the GRCh38 equivalent positions using pre-mapped equivalency tables derived from the CrossMap tool doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt730. Users should specify the assembly if they know it. However, ProtVar will by default attempt to predict which assembly the user has submitted by comparing the nucleotides at each user entered coordinate against each reference assembly. This will not work reliably for very small (<10) numbers of variants submitted.

<a name="genomic-coordinates-to-protein-positions"></a>**Genomic Coordinates to Protein Positions:**

<a name="gnomad"></a>**gnomAD:** Users may want to copy and paste variants directly from the GnomAD UI to rapidly retrieve annotations, the gnomAD website can be found here: http://www.gnomad-sg.org/. The following VCF-like format is therefore supported in ProtVar:   
>X-149498202-C-G

<a name="hgvs"></a>**HGVS:** Variants can be submitted to ProtVar using the HGVS nomenclature standard for single nucleotide polymorphisms. This format differs from VCF in that it incorporates the reference sequence the coordinate is based upon, for example: 
>NC_000023.11:g.149498202C>G  

Futher details about the HGVS format can be found here: https://varnomen.hgvs.org/bg-material/simple/

<a name="isoforms"></a>**Isoforms:** ProtVar maps from genomic coordinates to as many different isoforms of the protein as possible. This is limited by the match between the translated transcripts and isoform sequences in UniProt. The isoform displayed by default is the Uniprot canonical isoform which is denoted by a logo “can”. All of the annotations are based upon the numbering in the canonical isoform. Other isoforms, where the variant may be in a different numerical position, are denoted by a logo “iso”.

<a name="gmissense"></a>**Missense:** ProtVar retrieves annotations and predictions for the evaluation of missense mutations. Missense mutations are single nucleotide changes which result in a codon which encodes a different amino acid. Synonymous mutations are also handled by ProtVar where a point mutation does not alter the encoded amino acid.

<a name="my-downloads"></a>**My Downloads:**

<a name="paste"></a>**Paste:** Several thousand variants can be pasted into the box (for longer lists please upload a file).

<a name="population-observations"></a>**Population Observations:** Descriptions of other humans with the same variation, variations in the same amino acid location or the same gene may help users to assess the likely effect of their variant. ProtVar retrieves IDs from several databases which report the same variant as the user query. It also pulls data on co-located variants at the same amino acid position along with accompanying disease notes. ProtVar also retrieves information regarding diseases which have been associated with the protein.

<a name="predicted-free-energy-change"></a>**Predicted Free Energy Change:**

<a name="protein-protein-interfaces"></a>**Protein-protein Interfaces:** Doi: 10.17044/scilifelab.16866202.v1.

<a name="protein-pockets"></a>**Protein Pockets:**

<a name="protein-position"></a>**Protein Position:** Variants annotations can be accessed in ProtVar via their protein accession and position. The proteins should be named according to the UniProt canonical isoform accession and numbered according to the UniProt canonical isoform. ProtVar maps the protein position to the genomic coordinates of the relevant codon on the GRCh38 assembly. ProtVar then considers the codon sequence and the reference and variant amino acids provided to calculate the exact coordinate(s) and the variant nucleotide(s). If there are more than one variant or coordinate which could be possible then both alternatives are shown on different rows in the results.

<a name="protein-position-to-genomic-coordinate"></a>**Protein Position to Genomic Coordinates:**

<a name="protvar-rest-api"></a>**ProtVar REST API:**

<a name="region"></a>**Region:**

<a name="structure-annotations"></a>**Structure Annotations:**

<a name="vcf"></a>**VCF:** VCF is a tab separated text file format. It contains information about a position in the genome. ProtVar evaluates the first five fields in each line, namely:  
>CHROM  - The name of the chromosome on which the variation is being called  
POS - The position of the variation on the sequence  
ID - An identifier of the variation for example dbSNP ID. This is not a mandatory field for ProtVar and can be left out or included as “.”  
REF - The reference base at the given position on the reference sequence. ProtVar always uses the reference of the most recent version of the assembly. If the user base does not match then a warning will appear on the results screen informing the user of the mismatch.  
ALT - The alternative allele at this position. This must be a single nucleotide for ProtVar.

Meta information and header lines are ignored by ProtVar
Further details regarding the VCF format can be found here: https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf

ProtVar is as forgiving as possible with regards to the input format and will attempt to interpret the input if possible. For example the following formats can be read:  
X 149498202 . C/G  
10 43118436 A C  
2 233760498 . G A . . .  
14 89993420 A G

Columns can contain “N/A” as a value indicating either:

- The user did not requested the data (for example if only mappings are requested without annotation)
- We can not provide a value for reasons such as:
  - No data exists in our database in the category for this variant
  - One of the external APIs is not working

- [ID](#id)
- [Reference_allele](#reference_allele)
- [Alternative_allele](alterntative-allele)  
  

<a name="user-input"></a>**A - User input:** 
This field replicates the user input with no changes to the format. Users can use this field to match their input data to the annotated output file.

<a name="chromosome"></a>**B - Chromosome:**

<a name="reference-allele"></a>**E - Reference_allele:** This is the reference allele. It is defined by the nucleotide identity at that coordinate in the reference genome build. If the user inputted nucleotide differs from the reference build the reference build nucleotide identity will be shown and not the user inputted identity. This conflict will be noted in the "notes" column. Any user inputs except 'A', 'G', 'C', 'T' will be flagged in the "notes section.

<a name="alternative-allele"></a>**F - Alternative_allele** This is the alternative allele and will always match the user input. Any user inputs except 'A', 'G', 'C', 'T' will be flagged in the "notes section.

###### <a name="mapping-notes-columns"></a>Mapping Notes Columns

<a name="mapping-notes"></a>**G - Mapping_notes:** Single column which describes potential issue with the user input. It will contain “N/A” if there is nothing to report. Possible issues include:  
- Invalid input - Such as a nonesense chromosome, a non-numeric coordinate of invalid nucleotides in either the reference or variant allele positions
- The input sequence does not match the reference. Possible reasons for this include:
 - user error  
 - an updated sequence in the reference build
 - because the user has submitted variants from a different reference genome such as GRCh37)
- Mapping not found. Reasons may include:
 - variant in an intergenic region
 - variant in an intronic region
 - no transcript maps to the canonical isoform

###### <a name="genomic-mapping-columns"></a>Genomic Mapping Columns

Contains information regarding mapping of the user variant input to the relevant gene(s), transcript(s) and codon. The category contains 6 columns:
- [Gene](#gene) 
- [Codon_change](#codon-change) 
- [Strand](#strand)
- [CADD_phred-like_score](#cadd-phred-like-score)
- [Canonical_isoform_transcripts](canonical-isoform-transcripts)
- [MANE_transcript](#mane-transcript)

<a name="gene"></a>**H - Gene** The gene symbol as defined by the HGNC (https://www.genenames.org/about/guidelines/)
Symbols contain only uppercase Latin letters and Arabic numerals, and punctuation is avoided, with an exception for
hyphens in specific groups.

<a name="codon-change"></a>**I - Codon_change** The format is three nucleotides containing the reference allele which make the codon, followed by “/” and then the
three corresponding nucleotides but containing the alternative nucleotide. The position which is changed is capitalised,
for example aCg/aTg where the middle nucleotide of the codon is changed from a Cytosine (C) to a Thymine (T).

<a name="strand"></a>**J - Strand** The reference genome and variants are stated as the positive strand only, therefore if a user enteres G->T variant but the gene is on the negative strand the codon change displayed will be C->A (the reverse complement).

<a name="cadd-phred-like-score"></a>**K - CADD_phred_like_score** The CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion) score is devised by the University of Washington - https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/ .
They calculate a score for every possible change in the genome. The phred-like score ("scaled C-scores") ranges from 1 to 99. It is based on the rank of each variant relative to all possible 8.6 billion substitutions in the human reference genome.

<a name="canonical-isoform-transcripts"></a>**L - Canonical_isoform_transcripts** The transcripts and transcript translation identifiers which correspond to the UniProt canonical isoform. Transcripts
(DNA sequences) have an ID starting with “ENST”. There can be several different transcripts which encode the same
isoform because they may differ in their untranslated (non-coding) regions at either end. The translated transcript has an ID
starting “ENSP”. For example [ENSP00000337353(ENST00000335725,ENST00000123456).

<a name="mapping-notes"></a>**M - MANE_transcript** MANE (Matched Annotation between NCBI and EBI). - One of the transcripts is selected as the representative by NCBI and Ensembl. This transcript
may not translate into the UniProt canonical isoform sequence. If the MANE select corresponds directly to the isoform described in the row the MANE select ID is given. If they do not match "N/A" is found in the column and the MANE select ID is found with the corresponding transcript in the "Alternative_isoform_mappings" column.

###### <a name="protein-mapping-columns"></a>Protein Mapping Columns

Contains information regarding mapping of the user variant input to the encoded protein(s). The category contains 6 columns:

- [Amino_acid_change](#amino-acid-change)
- [Consequences](#consequences)


<a name="mapping-notes"></a>**N - Uniprot canonical_isoform (non_canonical):** This is the accession of the canonical isoform of the protein if ProtVar can map to this. ProtVar always attempts to map to this isoform because
most of the UniProt annotations are based on numbering in the canonical. Sometimes ProtVar cannot map to the canonical isoform
but can to another isoform (sequence version of the protein). In these cases brackets are displayed around the accession to show that the mapping is to a non-canonical isoform.

version of the reference.

<a name="predicted-pockets"></a>**AK - Cytogenetic_band:** The region of the chromosome containing the variant position. Cytogenic bands are areas of chromosomes rich in
actively transcribing DNA.

<a name="other-identifiers-for-the-variant"></a>**AL - Other_identifiers_for_the_variant** Description of the same variant (position and nucleotide change) as the user entered in different databases.
The source database name is given, separated by the variant ID with "-" then separated from the clinical consequence with ";". Each separate databse is separated by "|". For example, 
> ClinVar-RCV000003593;Pathogenic|UniProt-VAR_017144;Pathogenic.

<a name="diseases-associated-with-variant"></a>**AM - Diseases_associated_with_variant** Describes diseases from literature which have been associated with the specific variant entered by the user. There may be multiple diseases
listed which are separated by “|”. The evidence for each disease is in brackets which may be a CliVar ID or Pubmed link to a publication.

<a name="variants-colocated-at-residue-position"></a>**AN - Variants_colocated_at_residue_position:** This column describes other variants which have been described at the same AMINO ACID position. As a codon is three
nucleotides this means that the variants here could be at any one of three positions and can be any alternative allele.

###### <a name="structure-annotations-columns"></a>Structure Annotations Columns

This category has one column:

<a name="other-identifiers-for-the-variant"></a>**AO - Position_in_structures:** The column shows which PDB protein structures contain the variant. This is not an exhaustive list of all structures
of the protein as some structures will not cover the region containing the variant.
The format is: 
> PDB_accesion;chain_position_in_structure,chain_position_in_structure;structure_resolution;structure_method. Structures are separated by "|".

##### <a name="api"></a>API

ProtVar REST API is a programmatic way to obtain information from ProtVar. You can query:

A list of variants via their genomic coordinates and choose which annotations you require. These can be posted as a list and then downloaded or emailed or a file can be uploaded.  
Genomic coordinates to retrieve mappings to positions in proteins for all isoforms  
Individual amino acid positions to retrieve functional/structural/co-located variant annotations via a json object
REST API uses OpenAPI 3 which means you can use utils like openapi-generator to generate model classes

##### <a name="direct-variant-link-help"></a>Direct variant Link Help

You can access variant annotations directly using a permanent URL which mean that you can bypass the input screen. You can use either genomic coordinates or protein positions but you must state both the reference and variant allele.

Examples of valid requests using genomic coordinates and protein information are given below.

Using genomic coordinates:

> /ProtVar/query?chromosome=19&genomic_position=1010539&reference_allele=G&alternative_allele=C  
> /ProtVar/query?chromosome=14&genomic_position=89993420&reference_allele=A&alternative_allele=G  
> /ProtVar/query?chromosome=10&genomic_position=87933147&reference_allele=C&alternative_allele=T

Using protein accession and position:

> /ProtVar/query?accession=Q4ZIN3&protein_position=558&reference_AA=S&variant_AA=R  
> /ProtVar/query?accession=Q9NUW8&protein_position=493&reference_AA=H&variant_AA=R  
> /ProtVar/query?accession=P60484&protein_position=130&reference_AA=R&variant_AA=T  
> /ProtVar/query?accession=P60484&protein_position=130&reference_AA=N&variant_AA=G
