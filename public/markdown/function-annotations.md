![ProtVar Function Annotations](images/function_annotations.png)  
**A.** This page contains the [function annotations](#further-info:function-annotations) relating to the variant position in the protein.  
**B.** This window contains data regarding the precise variant position in the protein from UniProt and predictions.  
**C.** Curated annotations retrieved from UniProt specifically pertaining to the protein position of the variant.
**D.**  The conservation of the wild-type amino acid from inter species alignments. A score of 0 represents the minimal conservation and a score of 1 is maximal conservation.
**E.** [The predicted free energy change](#further-info:predicted-free-energy-change)  in the protein when the reference amino acid is replaced with the variant as calculated using foldX v5.0 on the AlphaFOld structure.
**F.** Predictions relating to the probability that the user entered variant has a pathogenic or benign consequence.
**G.** Information regarding the [region](#further-info:region) in which the variant position is located from UniProt.  
**H.** Curated annotations retrieved from UniProt pertaining to the region of the protein surrounding  the variant.
**I.** Predicted [protein pockets](#further-info:protein-pockets) containing the variant position containing data on the physicochemical properties and confidence of the pocket prediction.
**J.**  Predicted [protein-protein interfaces](#further-info:protein-protein-interfaces) containing the variant position with information about the quality of the interface and the proteins involved.
**K.** A description of the function of the protein from UniProt.  
**L.** This window contains information about the reference protein from UniProt.  
**M.** Protein names and identifiers and UniProt entry information.  
**N.** [General protein information](#further-info:general-protein-information) from UniProt.  
**O.** [Ensembl identifiers](#further-info:ensembl-identifiers) for the gene and for the transcript which translates to the UniProt canonical isoform.
